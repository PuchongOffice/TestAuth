# TestAuth

We need to use this to teach new hires how to authenticate their apps with the encrypted network.

# STEP 1

Download the <a href="https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_examples/releases">Website Uploader</a> (called web_hosting_manager)

# Step 2

Download the <a href="https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_browser/releases">Encrypted Browser</a>

# Step 3

Open the Browser & make an account with the Invitation Token that I sent you on Facebook
<br>*If it gives an error, then login to <a href="http://safenetforum.org">safenetforum.org</a> with the user/pass I sent you, and then register your token at <a href="http://invite.maidsafe.net">invite.maidsafe.net</a>

# Step 4

Download the <a href="https://github.com/PuchongOffice/TestAuth/blob/master/index.html">index.html file above</a>, in this Github project

# Step 5

Use the Website Uploader software to upload it to the Encrypted Network

# Step 6

With the Encrypted Browser, visit the URL that it gives you, like "safe://yourWebsite.yourID" to view the TestAuth page.

# Step 7 -- Final!!

Click the "Authorize" button and if it authorizes and shows the "SUCCESS!!!" message, you pass!! Collect $$ payment!!
