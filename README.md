# TestAuth

We need to use this to teach new hires how to authenticate their apps with the encrypted network.

# STEP 1

Download the Browser and the Uploader software programs from **<a href="https://github.com/willgallo3/OfflineVersion">this repository here</a>**. (or get the <a href="https://github.com/willgallo3/OfflineVersionLinux">Linux Version here</a>)

# Step 2

Open the Browser and make an account. *You can type any text into the "Invitation Token" field and it will pass!*

# Step 3

Download the <a href="https://github.com/PuchongOffice/TestAuth/blob/master/index.html">index.html file above</a>, in this Github project

# Step 4

Use the Website Uploader software to upload it to the Encrypted Network

# Step 5

With the Encrypted Browser, visit the URL that it gives you, like "safe://yourWebsite.yourID" to view the TestAuth page.

# Step 6 -- Final!!

Click the "Authorize" button and if it authorizes and shows the "SUCCESS!!!" message, you pass!! Collect $$ payment!!

**Now you know the development flow. When you work on HTML files, you upload them in this way to test. Now you are ready to work on our larger projects, using this system, like <a href="https://github.com/PuchongOffice/JS-Job-1">this one here</a>.Great job!**
